<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Marshall Bruce Mathers III (now known as Eminem, or his alter-ego Slim Shady) was born on October 17, 1972 in Kansas City, Missouri. Eminem's father, Marshall Bruce Mathers Jr. abandoned him when he was 18 months old and he was raised by his mother, Debbie Nelson Mathers-Briggs from that point on.</p>



<p>Early on, Marshall and his mother (just 15 when he was born) bounced back and forth between Kansas City and Detroit, living in public housing systems - forcing Em to constantly change schools and start from scratch socially, in tough urban neighbourhoods, that didn't take so kindly to new (or white) faces. A lack of stability meant he was always an outsider, struggling to find his idendity or any true home base. He was also a target of violent bullying, both in the schoolyard and in the local streets that surrounded him. This tormented existence made Em somewhat of a recluse as a child, often staying alone in his bedroom, often sketching his heroes and creating his own realities, in relative peace.</p>



<p>Eminem says that his mother never had a job (though she disputes this, and many of his claims relating to his childhood) and that they survived solely on welfare checks and occassional payouts from lawsuits which she would dream-up over minor incidents. There is some objective evidence to support Marshall's claims of his mother's history however, as her legal records show an extensive list of cases where she has tried to exploit a plethora of people and organizations, over spurious incidents. She would also later go on to sue Eminem himself, in 2001, for defemation of character. She claims that these wheels were set in motion by her lawyer, without her go-ahead, and that she did not intend to sue her son.

This seems unlikely though given the fact she went through with the dispute to the end (therefore advocating and arguing the accusation), resulting in a minor out-of-court settlement.

Eminem also has a younger brother, Nathan Mathers, now an aspiring rapper, going by the name Nate Kane. Eminem has claimed that he practically raised Nathan himself and that his mother would abuse his little brother, constantly pretending he was ill. This claim has been validified by the fact that Debbie was diagnosed with Münchausen syndrome by proxy and had Nathan taken from her by social services. Münchausen syndrome by proxy is a mental disorder where the affected person pretends to see illness in others, or inflicts physical or psychological stress to give such appearance. It has said to be most common for single mothers vying for attention (and sympathy) to do this with their children, and it is considered a form of child abuse. He also says she did this to him, but to a smaller degree than with his brother, and that seeing his mother's abuse of Nathan brought back memories. He references this in his 2002 hit "Cleaning Out My Closet"...</p>

"Victim of Münchausen's syndrome. My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't."

As a bullied youth, Eminem found solace in emulating and basking in the rebellious and 'take no shit' attitudes of rap groups such as N.W.A. Eminem has said that hearing the ideas of groups like N.W.A helped him develop a personality and confidence to defend himself against local bullies. Which in a broader sense, could of been the tipping point that eventually led to his smartass and often aggressive persona's we've heard in his music.

"An angry teenager, nothing can change me back - Gangsta rap made me act like a maniac."

Eminem was first introduced to hip</p>


<h2>Professional Carrear</h2>

<p>Being a rap fan for most of his life, Marshall began rapping at the early age of 4. Rhyming words together, battling schoolmates in the lunchroom brought joy to what was otherwise a painful existence. At the age of 14, he began to get very serious about his rapping but it wasn't until he was 17 that he actually made a name for himself, becoming M&M, which he would later respell as "Eminem". Being rejected by most fellow rappers because of his race, Marshall grew an anger that flows through his music to this day. After failing the 9th grade for three times in a row, he quit school, but has remarked that he does not consider himself stupid and does not advise that people should follow his example. He says that it just wasn't for him. Forcing himself on radio shows, freestyle battles, Marshall threw himself head first into the rap game, where he was swallowed up most of the time. His very first album was titled "Infinite" and, while the album sold less than a thousand copies, it was the gearing up stages for the rapper who became a millionaire. It was then that his daughter, Hailie Jade Scott, was born on December 25th of 1995 with long time girlfriend Kim Scott.
</p>


<p>Having nothing to lose at all, flat broke and not knowing where he would be living the next week, Marshall set out to rant about life in general, the set quickly caught the ear of hip-hop's difficult-to-please underground. What came out of this was the Slim Shady EP, the early work for the later Dr. Dre revised Slim Shady LP. Down to nearly his last dime, he went into the 1997 Rap Olympics in Los Angeles, basically hoping to win the $1,500 cash prize which he badly needed. After battling for an hour and throwing back every race diss thrown at him, Marshall made it to second place losing in a slip up. Furious that he had lost, Marshall didn't even notice that he had been spotted. In the crowd were a few producers from Interscope, and they were handed a copy of the "Infinite" tape by way of a demo.

Dr. Dre got to hear it and eventually tracked him down. The two instantly hit it off, recording four songs in their first six hours of working - three which made it to his first LP. After the album was finished, Dr. Dre asked Marshall to come work with him on his new album. He helped produce several tracks and was on the best songs of the album. Now officially making it, Marshall and Dre set to make his second LP. The album became the Marshall Mathers LP and won 3 Grammies and was the first rap album ever to be nominated "Album of the Year", selling more than 8 million records in the United States alone. He also stunned critics when he shot down all homophobic remarks by performing "Stan" with Elton John. Eminem made a movie, 8 Mile (2002). Though 2001 was a rough year for the rapper, being charged with weapon offenses, divorcing his wife, and almost going to prison, Marshall has explained his life in one word: "Claimer"</p>
